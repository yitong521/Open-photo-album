# Webpage Introduction and Display Compatibility Report

## Webpage Overview
1. Internal Navigation Bar: At the top of the webpage, we've included an internal navigation bar for easy access to different sections. It contains links allowing users to navigate directly to specific content areas.
2. Webpage Introduction: In the main body of the webpage, we provide a detailed overview of its features, including images and decorative elements, to give users a clear understanding of the overall content.
3. Global Site Navigation: Positioned at the top or a suitable location, the global site navigation allows easy navigation to other relevant webpages. This navigation bar can be further enriched to provide more useful links.
4. Film Gallery Introduction: In the middle of the page, we provide a detailed introduction to the film gallery section, offering users a clear understanding of this specific content.
5. Footer Form: At the bottom of the page, we provide an input form for users to submit information or interact with the website.

## Browser
1. Handling Browser-Specific Features in HTML:
When dealing with different browser-specific features in HTML, developers can employ conditional comments for Internet Explorer (IE) versions or use feature detection for modern browsers.
2. Here are some examples of subtle differences that may arise when writing HTML and CSS:
- Box Model Differences: The interpretation of the box model may vary slightly across different browsers. In the IE box model, the width and height properties encompass content, padding, and borders, whereas in the standard box model, the width and height properties only include content. for standard: box-sizing: content-box; for IE box-sizing: border-box
- Float Clearing: When dealing with floated elements, different browsers may have variations in the way they clear floats. Some browsers may require additional CSS rules for float clearing.
- Flexbox may exhibit differences in prefixes and property values across different browsers.
## Print-Related Designs
1. Image Optimization: To ensure a more concise printout and save ink, images have been removed from the website introduction section, retaining only essential images in the movie list.
2. Table Adjustments: For the main content area (main-content) table, column widths have been adjusted during printing to enhance aesthetics. "Add Movie" options in the last two rows have been removed to avoid printing unnecessary webpage functionalities.
3. Simplified Webpage Footer: To further simplify print content and focus on main information, explanatory text at the bottom of the webpage has been removed.
4. Page Neatness: For ease of reading and reference, each line in the main-content area is now fully displayed on the same page during printing, preventing splitting across different pages.
5. Differences between Landscape and Portrait Orientations:
   - Font Size: Increase font size when printing in landscape orientation to accommodate wider pages while maintaining a normal or slightly smaller font size for portrait orientation.
   - Tables and Images: Resize tables and images to fit different printing orientations.

## Mobile/Pad Mini-Related Designs
1. Overall Layout Adjustment: Reduce overall page margins to enhance compactness.
2. Navigation Bar Style Optimization: Through media queries, navigation list items are vertically arranged on small screens and horizontally centered. Max-width and margin settings limit the navigation module's width, and zero padding in media queries ensures a more compact style on small screens. This section reserves JavaScript interaction for implementing a hidden menu in subsequent stages.
3. Feature Area Content Presentation: On small screens, textual content is presented first, followed by image content, ensuring they are not displayed on the same line for improved readability.
4. IMDb Clicks and Interaction Optimization: To increase touch area on mobile devices, ensure users can trigger prompt messages by tapping near the IMDb abbreviation. Clicking anywhere near IMDb on small screens should trigger the same prompt, enhancing user experience.
5. Image Layout Adjustment: On small screens, the image section displays one image and its corresponding explanation per row, rather than four rows side by side, adapting to limited screen width.
6. Category Section Style Adjustment: On small screens, the category section vertically arranges each div, reducing inner and outer margins for a more compact appearance. JavaScript will be used in subsequent stages to implement a dropdown menu.
7. Large Table Modular Display: On small screens, each row of the large table is modularly displayed, showing the poster first, followed by name, year, genre, and rating. By hiding column names and adjusting row spacing, the page becomes more suitable for small screen sizes.
8. Image Resolution Optimization: On small screens, reduce the resolution of all images by 30% to accelerate page loading and enhance user experience.
